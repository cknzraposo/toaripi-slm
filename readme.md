> **A small language model for generating educational content in Toaripi language**

**Status:** Research Prototype | **Language:** Toaripi (East Elema), Gulf Province, Papua New Guinea (ISO 639‑3: `tqo`)

This project develops a **small language model (SLM)** for the Toaripi language to support **language preservation** and **education**. The model is trained on aligned English↔Toaripi Bible text and designed to generate original educational content for primary school learners and teachers.

## 🎯 Project Mission

**Empower local educators with AI tools** that create culturally relevant learning materials while preserving the Toaripi language through:

- 📚 **Original educational content generation** (stories, vocabulary, Q&A, dialogues)- 📚 **Original educational content generation** (stories, vocabulary, Q&A, dialogues)

- 🌐 **Online and offline deployment** (including Raspberry Pi and low-resource devices)- 🌐 **Online and offline deployment** (including Raspberry Pi and low-resource devices)  

- 🤝 **Open-source collaboration** with Toaripi speakers, linguists, and developers- 🤝 **Open-source collaboration** with Toaripi speakers, linguists, and developers

- 🎓 **Educational focus** over general-purpose chatbot functionality- 🎓 **Educational focus** over general-purpose chatbot functionality

## ✨ Key Features

- This project focuses on creating a small AI language model (SLM) for the Toaripi language of Papua New Guinea to support language preservation and education. It uses aligned English–Toaripi Bible text as training data and aims to:

### 🧠 **Smart Content Generation**

- Generate original educational content (stories, vocabulary lists, comprehension questions) for primary school learners and teachers.

- Create educational stories and vocabulary exercises

- Work both online and offline, including on low-resource devices like Raspberry Pi, through model quantization and lightweight deployment.

- Generate reading comprehension questions and dialogues

- Be open-source, hosted on GitHub with clear documentation, scripts, and contribution guidelines to invite collaboration from developers, linguists, and the Toaripi-speaking community.

- Produce culturally relevant educational materials in Toaripi

The ultimate goal is to empower local educators with AI tools that create culturally relevant learning materials while preserving the Toaripi language.

### 💻 **Flexible Deployment**

- **Online**: Web UI and REST API for connected environments**Status:** research prototype • **Focus:** Toaripi (East Elema) language, Gulf Province, Papua New Guinea (ISO 639‑3: `tqo`)  

- **Offline**: Quantized models (GGUF) for CPU-only devices**Purpose:** A small language model (SLM) for **language preservation** and **education**, trained primarily from parallel **English↔Toaripi Bible** text (aligned by chapter/verse). The model is designed to **generate original educational content** (e.g., simple stories, vocabulary lists, reading comprehension questions) suitable for **primary school learners**, and to operate **both online and offline** in low‑connectivity environments.

- **Edge**: Optimized for Raspberry Pi and low-resource hardware

> *This repository will host the code, data tooling, model checkpoints (or pointers), and deployment patterns for educators, local contributors, and researchers.*

### 🔧 **Developer-Friendly**

- Modular Python architecture with clear APIs
- Comprehensive configuration management## Why this project?
- Docker support for easy deployment
- Extensive testing and documentation- **Language preservation:** Support Toaripi literacy by bootstrapping written content and teaching resources.
- Go to [Dev Setup](devsetup.md) for instructions.

- **Education first:** Help teachers quickly create exercises, stories and quizzes **in Toaripi**, not just translations.
- **Low-resource focus:** Enable offline use on affordable hardware like Raspberry Pi for remote communities.
- Open-source to invite collaboration from linguists, educators, and developers.
