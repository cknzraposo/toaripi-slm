## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A Toaripi teacher wants to create educational content using a local language model. They need to prepare training data from Bible translations, start a training session, monitor progress, and manage the resulting model - all without requiring internet connectivity or deep technical knowledge.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a teacher has CSV files with English-Toaripi parallel text, **When** they run the data preparation command, **Then** the system validates, processes, and formats the data for training with clear progress feedback
2. **Given** prepared training data exists, **When** the teacher starts a training session, **Then** the system begins model fine-tuning with real-time progress updates and estimated completion time
3. **Given** a training session is running, **When** the teacher needs to stop training, **Then** the system safely saves the current checkpoint and allows resuming later
4. **Given** multiple training runs exist, **When** the teacher lists available models, **Then** the system displays model details including training date, performance metrics, and file locations
5. **Given** a trained model exists, **When** the teacher tests content generation, **Then** the system provides interactive text generation with educational content validation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when data preparation encounters malformed CSV files or missing translations?
- How does the system handle interrupted training due to power loss or system shutdown?
- What occurs when disk space becomes insufficient during training?
- How does the system respond to incompatible model formats or corrupted checkpoints?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an interactive command-line interface with menu-driven navigation for non-technical users
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate and prepare parallel English-Toaripi training data from CSV files with clear error messages for data quality issues
- **FR-003**: System MUST start, pause, resume, and stop model training sessions with checkpoint saving for recovery
- **FR-004**: System MUST display real-time training progress including loss metrics, estimated completion time, and current epoch information
- **FR-005**: System MUST manage multiple model versions with listing, comparison, and selection capabilities
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate sample educational content using trained models with validation for cultural appropriateness
- **FR-007**: System MUST operate entirely offline without requiring internet connectivity for core functionality
- **FR-008**: System MUST run consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate system requirements (RAM, disk space, dependencies) before beginning operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide comprehensive logging with different verbosity levels for troubleshooting
- **FR-011**: System MUST backup and restore training configurations and model checkpoints
- **FR-012**: System MUST export trained models in formats suitable for edge deployment (GGUF for Raspberry Pi)
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide guided setup wizard for first-time users to configure training parameters
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to preview and validate training data before beginning model training
- **FR-015**: Users MUST be able to configure training parameters through guided prompts with educational defaults

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Training Session**: Represents an active or completed model training run with start time, duration, status, checkpoints, and performance metrics
- **Dataset**: Prepared training data including source files, processed format, validation status, and statistics (word count, language balance)
- **Model Configuration**: Training parameters including learning rate, batch size, epochs, LoRA settings, and educational content focus areas
- **Model Checkpoint**: Saved model state during training including weights, metadata, performance metrics, and resumption information
- **Training Log**: Detailed record of training progress, system events, errors, and performance data for debugging and analysis
